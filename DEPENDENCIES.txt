# Python --------------------

# pax and OpenTAL are needed for the i18n_xgettext.py script.

# PAX - the "Pythonic API for XML" - is a XML-handling library
pax >= -1.0a3

# OpenTAL is used to navigate through the ZPT files
OpenTAL >= 0.5


cd /tmp
tar xvf /home/download/_packages/pax-1.0a3.tar
cd pax
../python setup.py build
../python setup.py install

cd ..
tar xvf /home/download/_packages/OpenTAL-0.5.tar
cd OpenTAL
../python setup.py build
../python setup.py install

# Troubleshooter: OpenTAL does not install ok using python2.4, but there's
# a workaround to make it work: just change the evaluateText method
# parameters (OpenTAL/Context.py, l.191 in version 0.5) from "def
# evaluateText(self, expr, None=None):" to "def evaluateText(self, expr):",
# as python2.4 does not allow assignments to None.

rm -rf ./pax ./OpenTAL
